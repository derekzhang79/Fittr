                    <p>Many people are familiar with the traditional exercises and how most will benefit their bodies, but not many people understand how to incorporate a goal into how to do each exercise. This is exactly what makes Fittr unique. By going much deeper than telling you to “do bench press” for chest or “do squats” for legs, Fittr creates a well organized strategy that instructs users how many sets and reps to do for each exercise and how to do each rep so that users most effectively reach their goals.</p>
